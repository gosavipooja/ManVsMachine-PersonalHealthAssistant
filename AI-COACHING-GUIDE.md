## üß† Prompt Engineering Strategy

### 1. **System Prompts**
Each prompt type has a specialized system prompt that:
- Establishes the AI's role and expertise
- Incorporates cultural context
- Sets response tone and length
- Defines output format

### 2. **User Prompts**
Structured prompts that include:
- **User Profile**: Age, gender, body type, culture, goals
- **Activity Data**: Recent logs, progress trends
- **Context**: Time, mood, weather, conversation history
- **Specific Instructions**: What type of response is needed

### 3. **Response Parsing**
Intelligent parsing that:
- Extracts structured data from natural language
- Handles various response formats
- Provides fallbacks for parsing errors
- Maintains consistency across responses

## üåç Cultural Personalization

### Indian Context
- **System Prompt**: "You understand Indian wellness traditions, Ayurveda principles, and cultural values around health and family."
- **Features**: Ayurveda references, family wellness, traditional spices, Namaste greetings
- **Examples**: "Consider adding turmeric to your morning routine", "Family meals are important for your wellness journey"

### Chinese Context
- **System Prompt**: "You understand Traditional Chinese Medicine, cultural emphasis on balance, and family health values."
- **Features**: TCM principles, qi energy, seasonal eating, balance concepts
- **Examples**: "Balance your yin and yang with this suggestion", "Consider seasonal foods for better energy"

### Mexican Context
- **System Prompt**: "You understand Mexican wellness traditions, family-centered health practices, and cultural food values."
- **Features**: Family-centered approach, traditional foods, community wellness
- **Examples**: "¬°Excelente! Your family wellness approach is working", "Consider traditional Mexican herbs for digestion"

## üí™ Body Type Personalization

### Ectomorph
- **Focus**: Calorie density, strength training, consistent eating
- **Tips**: "Add healthy fats like nuts and avocados", "Focus on strength training over cardio"

### Mesomorph
- **Focus**: Balanced training, moderate calories, variety
- **Tips**: "Your body responds well to balanced workouts", "Include variety in your training"

### Endomorph
- **Focus**: Regular cardio, portion control, metabolic support
- **Tips**: "Focus on portion control and timing", "Regular cardio will help your metabolism"

## üîß Development & Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Test all prompts
node test-ai-prompts.js

# Test specific cultural contexts
node -e "require('./test-ai-prompts').testCulturalContexts()"

# Test body types
node -e "require('./test-ai-prompts').testBodyTypes()"
```

### Prompt Testing Endpoint
```http
